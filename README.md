# FoxPhrase_API

REST API | Django | Python | SQLite

This is the REST API for the Fox Phrase mobile game. This is a locally tested version of the API; the real Django API for Fox Phrase is currently on a Linux server. All of the code on here is identical to the Django API currently in use, except for the Secret Key and passwords, of course ;)
